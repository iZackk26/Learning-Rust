# Learning

I chose this language because it is a compiled language that facilitates
cross-platform compatibility. This allows me to develop apps that can run on
any operating system.

## Why did I choose Rust?

* So first of all it has a lot of things that are great right now on the market
  like security, performance, Expressive Syntaxis and a lot of stuff.


## Benefits of programming in Rust

* Memory Safety:
    Rust's ownership system and borrowing rules help prevent common
    memory-related errors such as null pointer dereferences and data races,
    making it easier to write robust and secure code.
* Performance:
     Rust is designed for high performance. It provides control over low-level
     details without sacrificing safety.
* Future-Proof:
    Rust is built to last and play nice with future updates, so you're less
    likely to run into surprises or major changes in the newer versions.

## I will be adding more information soon!
